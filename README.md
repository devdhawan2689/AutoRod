# Autorod

Autorod was a project created to automate sending peronalized emails to multiple people.
All you have to do is just provide a CSV File which contains the "Name" and "Email ID" of people and an Email Template File.
The code will automatically update the Name for each email.

Note - The SMTP library no longer works for "Gmail" since they have updated their security features. If you figured out a way to make it work hit me up and I will update that part of the code.
