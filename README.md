# Autorod

Autorod was a project created to automate sending peronalized emails to multiple people.
All you have to do is just provide a CSV File which contains the "Name" and "Email ID" of people and an Email Template File.
The code will automatically update the Name for each email.

PS - The project was made as a website which would be live and available for anyone to use. If you wish to use it as standalone python code you might need to extract the relevant function and make few changes to the variables. 
Note - The SMTP library no longer works for "Gmail" since they have updated their security features. If you figured out a way to make it work hit me up and I will update that part of the code.
